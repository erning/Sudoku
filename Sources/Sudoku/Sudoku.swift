 The Rules of Sudoku
 
 The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid
 is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

 The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to
 contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can
 only appear once in a row, column or box.

 The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, or
 horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square,
 must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.

 Every puzzle has just one correct solution.
